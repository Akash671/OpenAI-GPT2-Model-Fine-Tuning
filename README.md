Fine-tuned GPT-2 Model for News Article Generation
This repository contains a GPT-2 model that has been fine-tuned for generating short news articles based on headlines. This model is designed to produce text in a style similar to concise news reports, making it suitable for quick content generation or as a starting point for more specialized generative AI tasks.

üìù Description
This model is a version of GPT-2 (gpt2), a popular open-source language model developed by OpenAI, further trained on a custom dataset. The original GPT-2 model is excellent at generating coherent text, and this fine-tuned version specializes in expanding news headlines into brief, coherent articles.

üìä Dataset
The model was fine-tuned using a synthetic dataset of 1000 examples. Each example consists of a prompt (a news headline) and a completion (a short news article related to the headline). The dataset was created to demonstrate the fine-tuning process for text generation on a specific domain.

Example Data Format:

{"prompt": "Tech Innovation Boosts Economy (Generated Sample 1)", "completion": "A groundbreaking new technology in renewable energy has been announced, promising to significantly boost the national economy and create thousands of jobs. Experts predict a rapid adoption rate across various industries. This update is part of the daily news brief. (Generated Sample 1)"}

(This data is saved in fake_text_gen_dataset.jsonl.)

‚öôÔ∏è Fine-tuning Process
The fine-tuning was performed using the Hugging Face transformers library in Python.

Base Model: gpt2

Tokenization: The AutoTokenizer from Hugging Face was used. A crucial step was setting the tokenizer's pad_token to the eos_token (End-Of-Sequence token), as GPT-2 doesn't have a default padding token. This helps in batch processing during training.

Data Preprocessing: For each training example, the prompt and completion were concatenated into a single sequence, followed by the eos_token (e.g., "{prompt}{completion}{eos_token}"). The model then learns to predict the next token in this combined sequence.

Training: The Trainer API from Hugging Face was utilized. This handles the training loop, including:

Loss Function: The model optimizes for Causal Language Modeling (CLM) loss, which is essentially predicting the next token in a sequence.

Optimizer: AdamW.

Epochs: The model was trained for 3 epochs.

Batch Size: Typically 4-8 samples per batch, depending on available memory.

Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated on a validation set at the end of each epoch using eval_loss.

üöÄ How to Use the Model (Inference)
To use this fine-tuned model for generating text, you'll need Python and the Hugging Face transformers and torch libraries.

Prerequisites
pip install transformers torch datasets

Loading and Generating Text
from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch
import os

# Define the path where your fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved
model_path = "./fine_tuned_gpt2_textgen" # Ensure this path is correct

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path)

# Ensure the tokenizer has a padding token defined
if tokenizer.pad_token is None:
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
    model.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id

# Create a text generation pipeline
generator = pipeline(
    'text-generation',
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    device=0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1 # Use GPU if available, else CPU
)

# Example prompt
prompt = "Tech Innovation Boosts Economy (Generated Sample 1)"

# Generate text
generated_text = generator(
    prompt,
    max_length=100, # Max total length of the output (prompt + generated)
    num_return_sequences=1,
    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id, # Crucial for generation
    do_sample=True, # Enable sampling for more diverse output
    top_k=50,       # Consider top 50 tokens for sampling
    temperature=0.7 # Controls randomness (lower is more predictable)
)[0]['generated_text']

print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
print(f"Generated: {generated_text}")

# Tip: You might need to post-process the generated text
# to remove the input prompt or any trailing special tokens.

‚ú® Future Improvements
Larger, Real-World Dataset: Fine-tuning on a more extensive and diverse dataset of actual news articles would significantly improve the model's quality and ability to generalize.

Evaluation Metrics: Implementing metrics like BLEU or ROUGE scores to quantitatively evaluate the quality of generated text.

Advanced Prompt Engineering: Exploring more sophisticated prompt structures during training to guide generation better.

Longer Text Generation: Adjusting max_length and exploring techniques for generating multi-paragraph articles.
